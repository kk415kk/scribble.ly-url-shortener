====================
1. The HTTP command used to change the response of /home to include my full name and the title of this course is: 
GET /home?title=Web%20Architecture&name=Kevin%20Kao HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

2. The command to set the redirect using a PUT request is:
PUT /wiki HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 18
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

url=www.google.com

We can verify this because the response body includes "Stored wiki => www.google.com" instead of "Stored wiki => en.wikipedia.org".

3. The command to set the redirect using a POST request is:
POST /wiki HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 18
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
